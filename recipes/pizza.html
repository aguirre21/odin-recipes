        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to 
                form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. 
                Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. 
                Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.
            </li>

            <li>
                Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. 
                Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. 
                Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.
            </li>

            <li>
                Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.
            </li>

            <li>
                Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 
                15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.
            </li>

        </ol>
